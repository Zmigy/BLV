My printer has 3 independant Z steppers. You need to set the physical location of the pivot point not the lead screws with
M671 X-36:345:346 Y157:301:17 S10 ; set drive mapping: Z3=Left Front, Z4= Right Rear, Z5=Right Front
You need to keep the same order of M671 as the drive assignent in M584
M584 Z0.3:0.4:0.5

Set your probe boundaries. My BLtouch is on the left of my hotend. M557 will be effected by M208

M557 X65:328 Y21:291 P4
