My printer has 3 independant Z steppers. You need to set the physical location of the pivot point not the lead screws with
M671 X-36:345:346 Y157:301:17 S10 ; set drive mapping: Z3=Left Front, Z4= Right Rear, Z5=Right Front
You need to keep the same order of M671 as the drive assignent in M584
M584 Z0.3:0.4:0.5

Set your probe boundaries. My BLtouch is left of my hotend. M557 will be effected by M208. If you get an error that says probe cannot reach boundary change M208 accordingly.
M557 X65:328 Y21:291 P4

My endstops are at Y max(rear of printer) and X max(right side of nozzle) which is configured with
M574 X2 S1
M574 Y2 S1

When it homes it does:
G1 H1 X355
G1 H1 Y355

If your X endstop is on the left of the hotend change the endstop location in config.g 
M574 X1 S1

You'll also need to change G1 in the homing files accordingly
G1 H1 X-355
